    professionalSummary: `I graduated in Japanese Studies at UAM because of my passion for languages, which gave me the opportunity to spend some time studying and living in Japan. After that, I decided to get into programming and pursue my career as a front-end developer.
    I combine my love for languages and programming with my love for design, photography, skating and everything related to audiovisuals.
        Despite my short professional experience in the sector, having studied abroad and having trained as a leisure instructor has helped me to learn how to work as a team. I have learned to work in a team, work under pressure and know how to adapt to any situation.`,
